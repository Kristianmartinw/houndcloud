# Houndcloud
## Hey there and welcome to Houndcloud.

Houndcloud is a Soundcloud clone where users can create an account and upload songs and listen to songs that other users have made but the twist is that the songs are barks of different dog breeds.

##Some other features include: 
> Creating playlists and addings songs you like to those playlists.
> Commenting on songs you like.

##Features to be implemented later: 
  - Adding a search bar to find either users, breed, songs, or playlists
  - Moving songs between playlists or deleting them from a playlist
  - Displaying songs on a playlist
  - Editing a playlist, song, username, and comment name
  - Uploading user profile pictures and having the ability to change them
  - Hitting a shuffle button to change genres so you can expand your barking musical tastes
  - Displaying the current song playing on the footer near the song player
  - Adding waves to songs
  - Dragging playlists and songs to change their order
  - Demo user

##Bugs that are still being worked on: 
> User can add songs on a user page to the playlist of the user they're currently on
> Clicking songs to play on home page changes the random breed
> The Delete Track and Delete Playlist persist even when not focused on tracks or playlists
> Deleting a Song and comment not updating without refresh
